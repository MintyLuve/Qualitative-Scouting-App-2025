\t \u2022 REEF =  The hexagonal structure with branches where coral can be scored. \n
\t \u2022 BARGE = The structure spanning the center of the field where alliances can score algae and robots can climb. \n
\t \u2022 PARKED = All parts of the robot are inside their alliance\'s BARGE ZONE. \n
\t \u2022 SHALLOW CAGE = All parts of the robot are above ground, hanging on the higher cage. \n
\t \u2022 DEEP CAGE = All parts of the robot are above ground, hanging on the lower cage. \n
\t \u2022 COOPERITION BONUS = If both alliance\'s human players score in the BARGE twice. \n
\t \u2022 AUTO RANKING POINT = Robot leaves the BARGE ZONE and scores at least one point. \n
\t \u2022 CORAL RANKING POINT = At least 5 coral on each REEF layer (If COOPERITION is scored, only 3 of the 4 layers need 5 coral). \n
\t \u2022 BARGE RANKING POINT = At least 14 points scored in endgame. \n</string>

\t \u2022 Once a team receives a YELLOW or RED CARD, a yellow rectangle will show next to the team number on the audience display. \n
\t \u2022 The BARGE has three segments of lights on each side of the truss which indicate progression toward and completion of the Coopertition Bonus and the final 20 seconds in the match. Once each alliance has scored two ALGAE all six segments will illuminate. The lights will flash to indicate that there are 20 seconds left in the match. \n
\t \u2022 If COOPERTITION is enabled, a handshake icon will be on the scoreboard.\n</string>
